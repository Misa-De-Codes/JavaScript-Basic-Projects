# My First JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my first repository where I have built a few projects to learn JavaScript. Feel free to use and explore the code!

## Projects

### Project Four: Password Generator

### Project Seven: English to Roman Numeral Converter

### Project Eight: Weather App

This project is a weather app that fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API. To make it functional, replace the API key and URL with your own.

```javascript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const apiUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=${apiKey}`;

fetch(apiUrl)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
        // Process and display the weather data
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching the weather data:', error));
```
